# Project 1: Calendar App

[Check out the site here!] (https://jacksona750.github.io/Project_1/index.html)

Welcome to the Calendar App, the application that allows users to build time management skills and progressively monitor future events with weather variables.

The application features an up to date calendar that outlines the user's week of events and forecasts weather (based on <b>Zip Code</b>) provided by the <b>Weather API</b>. This component allows users to base future events on weather predictions and no longer be stunted by a rainy day! 

And scheduling events is easy.  Either click on the calendar, or click "Add an Event", and fill out the required fields in the Event form to get started. 

To ensure timeliness, scheduled events carry default 10 minute reminders.. 

There are movie fans; there are film lovers; and then there are cinephiles. Using the <b>Gracenote Developer API</b>, a user can access current showtimes and theatres within a 5 mile radius. To narrow their search users can input a specified date and zip code to register the movie database. Upon click of a button, a user can then add the movie event to their calendar.

Active users can access their week events by entering their credentials on the “Sign In” page which is secured by <b>Firebase User Authentication</b>. New users can create an account by completion of simple form on the “Sign Up” page.


It goes without saying, the Calendar App is life changing, and handy for any individual looking for structure and leisure activities.

Note: all location based functions are based on <b>Zip Code</b>, not other address information.
